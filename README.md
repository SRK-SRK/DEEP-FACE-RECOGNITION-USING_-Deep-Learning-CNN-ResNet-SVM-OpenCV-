# DEEP-FACE-RECOGNITION-USING_-Deep-Learning-CNN-ResNet-SVM-OpenCV-
Designed and implemented a deep face recognition system leveraging CNN-based feature extraction (ResNet) and  SVM classification. Enabled identity verification through embedding similarity and ROC-based threshold selection.  Achieved high accuracy and robustness across varying lighting and pose conditions.
